                    <p>
                        At FLOCAL, your privacy is a top priority. Your privacy is at the core of how we design and
                        build the
                        services and
                        products you know so that you can fully trust them and focus on building meaningful connections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We appreciate that you put your trust in us when you provide us with your information and we do
                        not take
                        this lightly.
                        Our commitment to privacy. We design all of our products and services with your privacy in mind.
                        We involve
                        experts from
                        various fields, including legal, security, engineering, product design, and others to make sure
                        that our
                        decisions are
                        taken with the utmost respect for your privacy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our commitment to transparency. Because we use many of the same online services you do, we know
                        that
                        insufficient
                        information and overly complicated language are common issues in privacy policies. We take the
                        exact
                        opposite approach:
                        weâ€™re doing our best to write our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain language. We
                        actually want
                        you to read
                        our policies and understand our privacy practices!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our commitment to security. We have teams dedicated to keeping your data safe and secure. We
                        constantly
                        update our
                        security practices and invest in our security efforts to enhance the safety of your information.

                    <p>By creating a FLOCAL account, whether through a mobile device or mobile application, you agree to
                        be bound
                        by our
                        Privacy Policy, each of which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement, and any terms
                        disclosed and
                        agreed to by
                        you if you purchase additional features, products or services we offer on the Service
                        (collectively, this
                        "Agreement").
                        If you do not accept and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement, please do not
                        use the
                        Service.</p>
                    <p>We may change this Agreement and the Service from time to time. We may do this for a variety of
                        reasons
                        including to
                        reflect changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or changes in business practices.
                        The most
                        recent version
                        of this Agreement will be posted on the Service under, and you should regularly check for the
                        most recent
                        version. The
                        most recent version is the version that applies. If the changes include material changes to your
                        rights or
                        obligations,
                        we will notify you at least 30 days in advance of the changes (unless weâ€™re unable to do so
                        under applicable
                        law) by
                        reasonable means, which could include notification through the Service or via email. If you
                        continue to use
                        the Service
                        after the changes become effective, then you agree to the revised Agreement.</p>

                        <li>FLOCAL is a combination of Feel + Local.</li>
                        <li>FLOCAL is a mobile application based on the concept of finding your native friends.</li>
                        <li>The app allows users to find their native fellow, and chat with them.</li>
                        <li>FLOCAL is for people who come to tier 1/tier 2 cities for many purposes. The purpose can be
                            education,
                            employment, etc.</li>
                        <li>It takes time to get comfortable in a new city.</li>
                        <li>They always feel like an outsider.</li>
                        <li> The first problem they feel in a new city is communication.</li>
                        <li>Even if they know English, they are frustrated about speaking English and want to find
                            people with whom
                            they can speak
                            their own local language.
                            But now the question is how they find people who are from the same hometown but are living
                            here in a
                            different city for
                            whatever reason.</li>
                        <li>So by using FLOCAL, people can find out about their region's people.
                            With whom they can speak in their own language and also visit some places together.</li>
                        <li>They can share their opinions on the restaurant they find, a place they visit, or organize a
                            get-together. They can chat
                            in groups or as individuals. Thus, people feel local even if they are not! With whom they
                            can speak in
                            their native
                            language and also visit some places together. They can share their opinions on the
                            restaurant they find, a
                            place they
                            visit, or organize a get-together. They can chat in groups or as individuals. This is how
                            you feel local,
                            even if you're
                            not local.</li>
                        <li>They also send requests to their friends and will be able to view or like their posts and
                            also chat with
